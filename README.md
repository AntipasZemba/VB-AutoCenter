Problem Statement:
 
Create a project that will be used to determine the total amount due for the purchase of a vehicle.  The application should accept the base price of the vehicle and any trade in allowance.  Also the application should allow for selection of the following options:  Sound System @ $500.00, Leather Interior @ $1000.00, and Computer Navigation @ $1,500.00.  In addition, the customer can choose an exterior finish of: Standard – no cost, Pearlized @ 500.00, or Custom Detailing @ $750.00.  
 
The application should:
• Calculate the total Accessories and Finish (AF)Price
• Add the Base Price to the AF Price and determine and display the sales tax (7% of the total).
• Display the total of the Base Price, AF Price, and the sales tax as a subtotal.
• Subtract “any” trade in allowance.
• Display the Total Amount Due.
 
 
Finally provide controls to “Clear” everything and “Exit” the application.
